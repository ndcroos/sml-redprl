### Engineering Notes

Having learned a bit from JonPRL's development, I'm compiling a bit of a
manifesto on various matters concerning the new codebase.

#### MLton first

We may support SML/NJ if our contributors want to, there we *only* require that
the MLton build work properly. There are a few reasons for favoring MLton:

- MLton implements Standard ML more faithfully; in addition to the (useful)
  extensions that SML/NJ provides to SML, there are a number of cases where its
  implementation is in fact incompatible with the definition. Whereas everything
  that MLton builds should also build in SML/NJ, I believe.

- MLton has powerful whole-program optimization. Originally, JonPRL was
  intended to be a library, and JonPRL proofs were just ML programs; under
  these circumstances, SML/NJ made a lot of sense, because it builds much faster
  than MLton. Today, however, JonPRL is a proof assistant, and so the trade-off
  is different.

- It is totally straightforward to produce an honest-to-god binary with MLton.
  I still have no idea what this "heap image" crap is about in SML/NJ.

Downsides of MLton are:

- Source code cannot contain unicode characters; in practice, this means that
  you have to use the decimal code in string literals.

- Builds take longer. In practice, by splitting parts of JonPRL into smaller
  libraries, we can still get reasonable build-and-code turnaround by only
  building the part of JonPRL that we are working on.

- There's no REPL. In practice, the REPL has not been used almost at all for
  day-to-day JonPRL development, so I do not see this is a very serious
  disadvantage. The only benefit of the REPL is that you can quickly print out some
  datastructure without writing your own pretty-printer for it.

#### No clever stuff

I want the code to be straightforward. I considered using `sml-open-ended`
again for operators, for instance, and in addition to the fact that it may be
non-trivial to make it work at higher kind, it's just another piece of the
codebase that is incredibly mystifying to people who don't understand what it
is.

#### Strike a balance with modularity

In JonPRL, everything was highly functorized; for instance, every module would
take as input an implementation of ABTs. We never actually took advantage of
this at all, and to be honest, it probably made a lot of stuff look more
abstruse than it really was. In the end, we were basically replicating the work
of the linker.

I'm thinking that this time around, we may wish to have certain "pervasive"
features like syntax exist globally.

#### Adhere to a common whitespace & lexical style

The whitespace and lexical style that I prefer is used in JonPRL and the ABT
library. Contributors are *not* required to adhere to this perfectly, but we
will ensure that no code is merged into master which does not match the
surrounding style.
